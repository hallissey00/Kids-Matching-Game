# Kids-Matching-Game
 The Memory Game Project In Java is a desktop card game that kids can play or for IT studentsâ€™ requirements for their school. On one side of each card, there is a picture, and each picture appears on two cards. At the start of the game, all of the cards are face down, and each player takes a turn turning over two cards.
